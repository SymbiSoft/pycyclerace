Starting from Nick Buch's nmea\_info.py ( http://gagravarr.org/code/ ), I've started to develop an tiny GPS application that is able to read gpx-tracks and draw them on the screen.

Using the positioning module the gps location is tracked and also can be logged.

The program guides the user to the closest location on the track. Once the user is on the track he gets text-to-speech information when he has to change his direction.

The application is written for the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, which has an internal GPS device and a touch screen.
